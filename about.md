Hi there. I suppose seen as you've clicked on the about page that you either want to know more about the reason for this blogs' existence, or in fact want to know a little more about myself. Firstly let me say that this blog was pulled together using the work of [YOUS](https://github.com/yous) existing template - I just added the words.

The reason for this blog is two fold; firstly I wanted to create a space of my own to practice writing. It's not something I take to very easily and with the added pressure of posting and 'showcasing' it, my hopes are to improve it somewhat. The second reason is that I have a fair few thoughts and feelings which I'd like to note down and work through. This is not becuase I have something particularly enlightening to share, I just enjoy the process of creating and forming my thoughts into words. 

As for me, I currently work in the IT sector in London...and thats about as much as you'll find out for now.
