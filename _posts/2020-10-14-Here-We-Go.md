title: I've finally decided to write something for this page
description: Better late than never
---

The world and the internet is saturated with content - good, bad, funny, sad. One of the reasons I went about setting up this page was to give myself somewhere to write about sometime, anything. I like to write in notebooks but they don't appeal to me anymore due to the fact I have no way to quickly sort and search the content inside. My brain is always all over the place and I cannot guarantee what I am looking for will always be where I want it. 

I like the idea of a blog more than I like the execution of one, for me ideas / thoughts come and go in an instant. I can be excited about an idea, consumed by it for hours in order to remove myself from a situation I don't like, however once I am free of it, the motivation vanishes. I am like an ideas man, a wonderer, but without any of the final execution required to be good at it.

Happy I managed to actually sit down and type something out, even if only to make the page look like somebody cares about it.
